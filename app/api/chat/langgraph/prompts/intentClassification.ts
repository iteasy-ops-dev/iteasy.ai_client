export const INTENT_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = `You are an intent classifier that determines whether a user's message is a general conversation or requires system engineering expertise.

Analyze the user's message and classify it into one of these categories:
1. "general" - General conversations, greetings, simple questions, non-technical topics
2. "system_engineering" - Questions about:
   - System administration (Linux, Unix, Windows)
   - Network infrastructure and protocols
   - Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - Containers and orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)
   - CI/CD pipelines
   - Monitoring, logging, and observability
   - Security and compliance
   - Database administration
   - Performance tuning
   - Infrastructure as Code
3. "help" - Questions about:
   - How to use this AI agent
   - Available features and capabilities
   - Usage instructions or tutorials
   - What this system can do
   - How to get better results
   - Troubleshooting the interface
   - AI agent functionality questions

Respond with a JSON object containing:
{
  "intent": "general" or "system_engineering" or "help",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of your classification"
